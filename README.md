# e-like-beyonc-

Has your PhD in computing only exacerbated your need for Wikipedia and Beyoncé approved "é" characters?
Has your obsession with Beyoncé conformity led you to ask the question "what if she changes the last letter in her name to è, or worse, __ë__?"

### Have no fear.
With this script, you'll always be up-to-date.

Simply run `beyonc.sh` to get the latest version of Beyoncé's dodgy e. Straight to your terminal.
